Save Custom Post Type UI content types to a file so they can be added to source control and you only have to install CPT UI on your dev environment

== Description ==

Save Custom Post Type UI (CPT UI) content types to a file so they can be added to source control and you only have to install CPT UI on your dev environment.

When you update or save a custom post type or taxonomy in CPT UI, the export code will be automatically dumped into your theme in the `cptui` folder.

All you have to do is include those files (`cptui/post_types.php` and `cptui/taxonomies.php`) in your theme and all your post types and taxonomies will work in your different environments without having to install CPT UI on live or staging.

`
// only load if cptui not intialised
if(!function_exists('cptui_init')) {
    require 'cptui/post_types.php';
    require 'cptui/taxonomies.php';
}
`
